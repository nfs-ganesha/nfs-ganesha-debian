  * A patch from Eric Sesterhenn about memleaks has been integrated.
  * Bug Fix : now check value of csa_flags for OP4_CREATE_SESSION

  * Changed bad #define in Log/log_functions.c (former situation could lead to
    possible buffer overflow

    integrated

    support for NFSv4.1 (mismatch in nfsv41.h and xdr_nfsv41.c)
